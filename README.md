# Chatbot's Chatbot

This project creates an interface that allows two chatbots created using the [BLiP](https://preview.blip.ai/) platform to talk to each other.

## How it works

At its core, it uses the basic functionality of a Chrome extension to talk to the page (BLiP Chat). It creates a chat within the page and takes care of exchanging the messages between them.
